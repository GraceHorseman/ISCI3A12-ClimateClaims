# Climate Claims Pt. 2: Finding the facts in a “post-truth” world
Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change., 2020. A CO2-induced Mechanism for Alleviating Growth Restrictions in Phosphorus Limited Ecosystems. [online] CO2 Science. Available at: <http://www.co2science.org/articles/V23/dec/a12.php> [Accessed 24 Jan. 2021].


  Keane et al. (2020) conducted a study to investigate how soil microbial extra cellular enzyme activity will respond to elevated CO<sub>2</sub> (eCO<sub>2</sub>) in phosphorus limited environments, which are increasing in number worldwide. The study found that under eCO<sub>2</sub> conditions, soil microbes reduced investment in carbon-cycling enzymes and instead increased investment in phosphorus- and nitrogen-cycling enzymes. The article by the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change (to be referred to as the Center throughout this evaluation) argues that a CO<sub>2</sub>-induced increase in below-ground carbon, allowed soil microbes to increase synthesis of P-cycling enzymes, thus alleviating P limitation and enhancing plant productivity in the study ecosystem. The article concludes that rising atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> will sustain, rather than destroy ecosystem growth. As Keane et al. (2020) note in their intro, a proper understanding of how nutrient limitation interacts with C uptake by ecosystems is crucial to addressing climate change, as terrestrial ecosystems are likely to sequester increasing amounts of C. 
  
  
  Craig Idso is the founder and current chairman of the Center, the group that produces the CO2 Science newsletter in which this claim was posted. Idso earned a PhD in Geography from Arizona State University, and since has been the author and co-author of various books and research articles. There are claims that the Center and Idso once received funding from ExxonMobil and the Heartland Institute (Heartland Institute, 2012). Though the authenticity of the evidence used in these claims is contested (McArdle, 2012), Idso’s affiliations with the oil and coal industry are undeniable. The Center was listed as a creditor in Peabody Energy’s bankruptcy filings (Vinson, 2002), and Idso has worked to produce reports for the Greening Earth Society — a group reliant on the Western Fuels Association (Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, 1999). 
  
  
  The influence of these clear ties to the oil and coal industry calls into question the credibility of the work published on CO2 Science; the reporting of the evidence presented in this claim and others from the newsletter do not guarantee objectivity. The article being evaluated — which has no named author — summarizes the results of Keane et al.’s (2020) paper relatively well. However, the claim does not correctly interpret the findings of the research. Contrary to the claim, the results of the paper do not report actual rates of nutrient cycling, increases in soil P availability, or the alleviation of P-limitation to plants, only the relative change in investment in C, N and P-cycling enzymes by soil microbiota is described. The article gestures at how the relative increase in P-cycling enzymes under the eCO<sub>2</sub> treatment supports greater ecosystem productivity and growth, however this study does not investigate how or if these changes in enzyme stoichiometry impact root, soil, and plant biomass. This claim fails to acknowledge that the results of the study reflect only one growing season and cannot explain unexplored long-term changes to nutrient cycling and nutrient limitation globally, or even in the two specific grassland conditions investigated. The article by the Center recognizes that increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> may benefit plant productivity, but fails to contextualize this claim within the competing and complex literature on the negative impacts of temperature change on plant growth and productivity (Sperry et al., 2016), and warming on positive soil microbial feedbacks (Nie et al. 2012). Further, the Center points to “numerous studies” that “[reveal] large and significant CO<sub>2</sub>-induced increases in global net primary productivity as ecosystems around the world have positively responded to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations”, yet this statement is unsupported by any references.
  
  
  Though Keane et al.’s (2020) proposed mechanism is intriguing and supported by the findings of Čapek et al. (2018), this does not, as the Center suggests, eliminate concerns for the sustainability of increased plant productivity induced by CO<sub>2</sub>. It is acknowledged that increased CO<sub>2</sub> has enhanced global plant productivity, but trends of increased global primary productivity in connection with changing atmospheric composition are uncertain. There is still limited understanding of these effects in tropical and boreal ecosystems, and the many interactions of rhizosphere nutrient cycling with temperature, precipitation, plant water availability, and stress responses have not yet been connected (Ainsworth, Lemonnier and Wedow, 2020; Zechmeister-Boltenstern et al., 2015).
